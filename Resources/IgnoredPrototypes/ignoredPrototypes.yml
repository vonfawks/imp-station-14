# This is a basic list that specifies files for which the prototypes inside of them will be made abstract.
# This supports all prototype kinds and is intended to allow servers to remove prototypes in a relatively clean way.
# This method does not break inheritance, but you will still have to remove usages.

# e.g., you can specify both directories and specific files by adding lines like:
#
# - /Prototypes/Guidebook
# - /Prototypes/Catalog/uplink_catalog.yml

# MAP PROTOTYPES
# All station map prototypes should be consolidated in Prototypes/_Impstation/Maps
# We're ignoring Wizden map prototypes in the base directory so any changes made by upstream merges can be safely ignored and maintain parity
# Map prototypes are ignored per-file instead of ignoring the entire directory, otherwise we would have to rename every prototype in salvage.yml, which would suck
# Any new map prototypes added by upstream should be added here, but since Pools/default.yml is being ignored, missing a prototype shouldn't break anything
