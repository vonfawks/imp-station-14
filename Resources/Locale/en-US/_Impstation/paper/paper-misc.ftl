book-text-animal-friends-kit = Thank you for choosing the Animal Friends Kit!
      Enclosed is a vial of dormant Subjuzine. Use the included syringe to portion out 4 doses (each dose is 5u).
      Injecting any non-sentient creature with Subjuzine will not only force them to follow your commands, but give them the gift of speech!
      Good luck, Agent. Go make some animal friends!
