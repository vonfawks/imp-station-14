        So, your station has been fitted with a supermatter crystal and you have no idea what to do. It's big, it's scary, and its humming is concerning. Thankfully, Supermatter for Dummies is here to help you out. It's not as scary as it looks, trust me. [color=#A80000]Unless it starts delaminating.[/color]

    Your station should have a full cooling loop built already, so all you have to do is turn a few things on and everything will be just fine! Before we get started, make sure to take precautions: you'll want to wear radiation protection, turn on your magboots, and [bold][color=red]do not touch the crystal[/color][/bold]. Do not throw anything into it, and do not turn the emitters on or adjust the supermatter's air alarm until your cooling loop is fully functional.

    Now, the supermatter generates radiation when it's struck by emitters, which we collect with radiation collectors. It also gets hot and produces oxygen and plasma, which can get bad very quickly! So, we have to make sure our cooling loop is as robust as possible.

    Go ahead and locate the nitrogen canisters near the crystal and, using your wrench, ensure they're attached to the input ports of the cooling loop. Turn the pumps on that are connected to these ports, and max them out! We want to be pumping as much gas through this system as possible.

    We want to ensure that this nitrogen is fed into the supermatter chamber, siphoned out, then sent to be cooled and fed back into the loop. To do this, find the pumps near the air alarm and enable them at maximum pressure. You may see a bypass pump near the outer airlock: this is for emergency use or more advanced systems, and should be ignored for now.

    From here, just follow the pipes through the loop. A filter should connect to storage canisters: you can ignore this for now. Simply enable it and keep the filter set to "none." Further down, you should see pumps connected to a cooling system, as well as a bypass pump. Ignore the bypass and enable the other two pumps to get our nitrogen as cold as possible!

    A set of filters is next in the loop. For this basic system, make sure nitrogen is being filtered back into the loop on at least one of these filters. The rest can be set to "none" to make sure no waste gas is entering our system. Keep following the loop, enabling pumps until the loop is complete.

    Go ahead and find the air alarm inside the airlocks. This is a [italic]very[/italic] important piece of equipment to set properly. Make sure to disable its automatic mode (there's a little button at the bottom!), enable the pressure lockout overrides on each vent, and set their pressure bounds to "internal". For the scrubbers, enable their WideNet function, and filter out all types of gas from the supermatter chamber.

    To finalise the supermatter engine, insert plasma cans into the radiation collectors and be sure to switch them on. Double-check your loop just to be sure: delamination can be very hard to stop once it's taken effect. If everything looks good, turn on all of the emitters, close the radiation shutters, and admire your beautiful work.
