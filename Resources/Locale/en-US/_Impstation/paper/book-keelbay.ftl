      ​[italic]Section one: Topicals[/italic]

      At shift start, empty the Nanovends of all topicals and Epi bottles and organize them.

      There are four bag colors for the four medical departments. Please organize topicals according to these colors. The topical bags should be located nearest to the stasis beds and be clearly visual without heavy overlap. 

      ​[color=green] Virology Duffle[/color]: Bruise Packs 

      ​[color=blue] Geneticist Duffle[/color]: Blood Packs

      ​[color=orange] Chemist Duffle [/color]: Ointment

      ​[color=#5b97bc] Medical Duffle [/color]: Gauze, Epi bottles

      If we are missing the [color=blue]Geneticist[/color] bag then we use Medical for Blood Packs as well.

      Topicals will also often be labeled by the CMO, if they are not labeled and you wish for them to be labeled please remind your CMO to label them. That or ask chem for the labeler.

      ​[italic]Section two: Medkits[/italic]

      Empty any available white, pink and yellow medkits into the topical duffles and the put the pills out into a free space. Fill up one emptied medkit with three health analyzers and take three empty medkits to Science and ask for Medibots. 

      Paramedics should take the poison and rad auto injectors from their respective kits to put on their belt. 

      The combat medkit from CMOs office will usually wind up with the salvagers. If cargo comes asking for empty medkits, either give them the leftover emptied medkits or make combat medkits (Which take up less space) in the medilathe. 

      ​[italic]Section three: Chemicals[/italic]

      We should have the following chemicals on the floor or being worked on before Advanced Brutes, Burns or Poisons are considered: 

      ​ - Bicardine
      ​ - Dylovene
      ​ - Dex + 
      ​ - Saline 
      ​ - Arith 
      ​ - Burn Mix [Or Derma]

      Once these are done we can worry about advanced chems. This will cover all early engagements with patients.

      Chems can be kept in satchels but the satchels must be secured within a locker near the beds. Unsecured chemicals in a satchel are VERY easy to steal from or just outright take. Keep the chem locker and the topical duffles a short distance from one another to avoid [color=red]catastrophes.[/color]

      ​[italic]Section four: Patient Etiquette[/italic]

      One person per patient. 

      Call out whatever you're injecting someone with. 

      If we have time before the nightmare claim beds or sections of Medbay as your territory and be aggressive with maintaining your territory to minimize havoc later or overdoses. 

      When a patient is good to go if we are busy you must have the patient leave. If non-medical staff are trying to assist with medical duties they are allowed as long as they do not handle chemicals. If you see a non-medical staffer with a needle, get territorial. We do not need the laymen trying to inject our patients.

      Additionally always be aware of your patients species. Do not inject a Snail with Saline or Dip 

      ​[italic]Section five: Pets[/italic]

      Non-Crew animals are DNR unless they are pets. 

      Pets are DNR when beyond 500 damage while On Green 

      Pets are DNR when beyond 300 damage while on Blue 

      Pets are DNR when on Red unless the CMO approves treatment. 

      ​[italic]Section five: Medilathe[/italic]

      The Medical Lathe is the fastest way to get more topicals in the exam room. It makes topicals one use at a time, so make them in amounts of 10 for a full stack of topical uses. This makes Plastic the primary choke material, plastic also being the material used to make Durathread for medical beds. If the medical lathe is empty it is usually the CMOs job to fill it but nobody will be mad if you go get materials for the lathe.

      ​[italic]Section six: Cryo[/italic]

      Cryopods are an intimidating part of the medical process. They are usually only necessary for treatment when a dead body has a type of damage untreatable with topicals or if topical use would be unreasonable.

      To set up the cryo chambers, turn on the gas pumps, distros (Filtering for Carbon Dioxide), and freezer (Setting temperature to 73.15K).

      Cryo Chemicals are not injected into the patient, instead they are placed into a beaker (Typically a 50u beaker) and then placed into the cryopod while a patient is within it.

      Cryo chemicals only affect the patient after they reach a certain coldness threshold. For the most basic Cryo chem (Cryox) this is around -50 degrees. You can check for a patients temperature on the cryopod while they are within it. Inserting the chemicals into into the cryopod early will waste the chemicals. 

      This process will happen faster on Reptilian patients due to their cold sensitives. Vox patients should also be sure to keep their internals on due to the presence of Oxygen in the cryopod.

      After any patient has been in cryo inject 5u of Leporazine to regulate their body temperature. 

      Cryo chemicals worth knowing are as follows: 

      Cryox: Basic cryo chemical that heals most types of damage on living patients 

      Alox: Cryo chemical that can heal burn damage on living and dead patients. 

      Dox: Cryo chemical that can heal genetic damage on living patients. 

      Necro: Cryo chemical that can heal damage on living and dead patients. 

      Oppo: Can reverse rot on patients.

      Please keep in mind many of these chemicals require cooperation with Botany and if you need them you will need to be in communication with Botany and their efforts. If you ever need Omnizine but don't have botanists communicate with Salvage that you need strange pills which can be ground up for a random allotment of chemicals. 

      ​[italic]Section seven: Mental[/italic]

      Medical as a job can be intense, demanding and unreasonably mired in bodies. You will see blood. You will see vomit. You will have patients who are unruly, random civilians who are blocking your path. 

      'The Medbay eats its young'

      My first CMO told me that. I was fresh out of medical school and during my first shift I cried in the backroom because I was shaking so badly I couldn't hold a needle. 

      With time, the chaos of a busy medbay will not be so daunting, but the chaos is inevitable. We simply must ensure whatever chaos exists in the bay is external. Never coming from within. Even at their worst we must persist. Even when the dead outnumber you in the bay you must persist. 

      We are the anchor.

      Without us the dead stay dead. 

      I suppose I'm just trying to say... You are not alone when we are overwhelmed. We as a medical staff are an anchor. We interlock, like polymers, to maintain our structure. Rely on your fellow doctor and you may survive the storm. 

      I pray you survive the storm.
