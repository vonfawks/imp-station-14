book-text-mansus = [head=2]On the Nature of the Mansus[/head]

      By Alyx Thorley, Head of the Acrypt Sector Anomalous Research Lab

      In the current day and age, one will frequently hear stories of an outpost brought to ruin. I've heard stories of everything from accidental nuclear detonations to hollowed-out corpses, but none have intrigued me like the stories of "magic", of sinister individuals drawing dark runes and grasping eldritch energy. As a person of science, my initial reaction was to laugh and easily prove beyond a doubt that magic does not exist. I'd like to think my research since then has opened my mind a bit more.

      First, our groundwork. These magic-wielding individuals - hereby referred to as "Mansus Scholars" - do exist. In fact, I am lucky enough to have been granted supervisory custody of one. Most of the information contained within this volume has been volunteered by this individual and subsequently confirmed by myself and my team.

      To understand a Mansus Scholar, one must first grasp the concept of the Mansus - which I'm sad to admit I haven't quite achieved. The following is my best interpretation of the rants and mutters of our local Scholar. Please regard it with the skepticism appropriate to its madly raving source.

      "Mansus" is best understood as a fundamental force of the universe, like electric charge or Bluespace. However, it is not nearly as integral to existence as those. As electric charge begets energy, and Bluespace begets physical space, the purview of Mansus is that of thought, of sentience and reasoning. Mansus is the catalyst that drove the first organisms to fire their first neurons.

      If you will, think of a human child in early medieval times rubbing their hands on a piece of wool to static-shock their sibling. Today, we understand that this is building up a slight capacitive charge, but the child only knows that rubbing the wool lets them shock someone. This is the level of understanding that Mansus Scholars have reached - an aggravatingly vague cause and effect. Our colleague frequently rants about how little he truly knows. He doesn't know why thinking certain thoughts allows him to channel flame from his hand, or why none of my understudies could replicate such a thing. 

      When one is at such a level of understanding, it's only natural for them to want more. Mansus is the energy of knowledge, so it follows that one could gain information using it. But how? To discuss this, we must discuss what I have dubbed the "Infinite Archives".

      Think of the Infinite Archives as Mansus' analog to Bluespace's hyperspace. Where hyperspace provides free, easy access to physical space - thus allowing FTL travel - the Archives provide unfettered access to knowledge. Allegedly, through the Archives, one could access any thought that any living being has ever had. The problem comes when trying to filter the secrets of the universe out from the trillions of meaningless thoughts, facts, and senses. A mind could learn maybe one or two useful bits of knowledge before it is so inundated with information it goes mad.

      Understandably, the Scholar does not want to go mad, so it uses a proxy. A person, a being with an advanced enough mind to reason. Scholars can sense those who will be useful to retrieve certain knowledge from the Archives. By sending that person's mind there briefly, a Scholar can retrieve useful knowledge at no harm to themselves. This is the heart of the Mansus Scholar's efforts - finding and sacrificing appropriate minds in order to harvest knowledge.

      In between their bouts of meaningless raving, our subjects have described the Archives as an impossibly vast library, with halls so long they seem to stretch over a horizon. It sounds like a wonderful place. Perhaps, once my colleague and I's studies have progressed, I will be able to safely visit it someday. Then, I will finally have unraveled the secrets of the Mansus.
