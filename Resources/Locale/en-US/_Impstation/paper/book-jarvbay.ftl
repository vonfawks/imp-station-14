    ​[italic]Oy, ye lot. [/italic]

    This document here is a compilation of good practices, tips and unspoken rules of engagement that all aim to make your life at Imp’s hellbays just a little less hellish!

    This ain’t a rulebook, this ain’t a guide. Take everything here with a grain of salt and feel free to add feedback. There’s no one “correct” way to do medical, but there are good and bad ways to tackle it.

    ​[color=DeepSkyBlue][head=2]1. Responsibilities of Medical Doctors[/head][/color]

    As an MD, your job is simple, care for the staff that comes into the medbay and monitor the health of the crew. As such, it is recommended to have at least one doctor responsible for handling the Crew Monitor. This is in most cases the paramedic, but it is good practice to have an MD eye it from time to time. You can also rotate this responsibility as, let’s be real here, it’s not the most exciting task. Get a buddy to chat up while you’re shouting at people in common over their injuries.

    Your main methods of doing treatment are topicals, pills, injections, medical beds and cryo. While injections are the most popular and, currently, the most effective method, it should not be your only option, and it won’t be now that decapoids are allowed into the sector. As a medical doctor, you must also respect the boundaries of your patients and respect any form of triggers and even the refusal to treatment if such a case arises. If you witness a patient that’s, say, triggered by needles, and another doctor is still administering treatment with needles, call a security officer to handle it ASAP. If that's not enough, don't be afraid to call CentComm directly.

    ​[color=DeepSkyBlue][head=2]2. Responsibilities of Chemists[/head][/color]

    As a Chemist, you have the not-so-easy job of preparing all of the medicine for the MD’s before disaster eventually strikes. You are the main supply and one of the deciding factors whether a medbay sinks or swims. It’s a tough job. There’s lots of responsibility to the task, and it may feel overwhelming for the entire department to depend on your performance. However, this shouldn’t stop you from experimenting!

    Let the team know in advance that you are green behind the ears to help them set the proper expectations. In the best case, you have another chemist on board to assist you, or the CMO is free enough to offer some guidance. Alternatively, on slow MD shifts, feel free to ask your CMO to allow you into the chem lab and experiment with some basic chems without the stress of the job, provided there’s a free CM and Dispenser.

    If there are any early incoming issues, e.g. a person spaced themselves on accident and are suffocating, but you have not made Dex+ yet, direct the doctors to the medkits around the bay, as there is one for every damage type and can handle minor injuries or one-time emergencies, even for damage that topicals don’t cover.

    Over time we’ve defined a set of chemicals we expect to see in our satchels and in how much time, but realistically, there’s only a few chems that are absolutely necessary:

    ​[italic]     [bullet] [color=#3a1d8a]███[/color] Dylovene - Poison
         ​[bullet] [color=#0064c8]███[/color] Saline - Bloodloss
         ​[bullet] [color=#4da0bd]███[/color] Dex+ - Asphyxiation
         ​[bullet] [color=#215263]███[/color] Dermaline / [color=#6f473e]███[/color] Burn Mix - Burns
         ​[bullet] [color=#ffaa00]███[/color] Bicaridine - Brutes
         ​[bullet] [color=#bd5902]███[/color] Arithrazine / [color=#848640]███[/color] Rads Mix - Radiation[/italic]

    As long as these chems are out sooner rather than later, you have the agency to handle the rest however way you want. Some pairs of chemists claim “bags” to take responsibility for the chemicals that generally appear in:

    ​[bolditalic]Satchel 1 (Generally a normal Chemist's Satchel): [/bolditalic]

    ​[italic]   [bullet] [color=#3a1d8a]███[/color] Dylovene
       ​[bullet] [color=#64ffe6]███[/color] Diphenhydramine

       ​[bullet] [color=#ffaa00]███[/color] Bicaridine
       ​[bullet] [color=#ff3636]███[/color] Bruizine
       ​[bullet] [color=#283332]███[/color] Lacerinol
       ​[bullet] [color=#b9bf93]███[/color] Puncturase

       ​[bullet] [color=#4da0bd]███[/color] Dexalin+
       ​[bullet] [color=#0064c8]███[/color] Saline[/italic]

    ​[bolditalic]in Satchel 2 (A Geneticist's or another distinct satchel):[/bolditalic]

    ​[italic]
       ​[bullet] [color=#bd5902]███[/color] Arithrazine / [color=#848640]███[/color] Rads Mix
       ​[bullet] [color=#215263]███[/color] Dermaline / [color=#6f473e]███[/color] Burn Mix

       ​[bullet] [color=#aa4308]███[/color] Pyrazine
       ​[bullet] [color=#ff7db5]███[/color] Leporazine
       ​[bullet] [color=#8147ff]███[/color] Insuzine
       ​[bullet] [color=#e0a5b9]███[/color] Sigynate[/italic]

    ​[bolditalic]and in a Cryo Bag (Medical or Chemist Backpack):[/bolditalic]

    ​[italic]   [bullet] [color=#0091ff]███[/color] Cryoxadone
       ​[bullet] [color=#c8ff75]███[/color]Dooxarubixadone[/italic]

    This is a perfectly valid method that makes it easy to separate tasks, as well as chemicals in specific categories of damage, but not at all necessary. Communicate how you prefer to handle the chems with your fellow chemists and the CMO.

    As a chemist, you also control the approach to which healing is done. With some requests to Science and Botany, you can instead opt into advanced topicals to treat bruises and burns. You can also request an additional CM to create a pillsbay. As long as your CMO is on board, it can be done.

    Over time, you may receive direct requests from certain people for chemicals. The urgency of these requests differ, but in most cases, the priority list is as such:

    ​[italic]      1. Most basic chems (the list above)
          ​2. Direct CMO requests
          ​3. Basic Botanist requests (mutagen, dylovene, dieth)
          ​4. One-time treatment requests (e.g. Oculine, if blood is provided)
          ​5. Advanced chems
          ​6 Personal requests.[/italic]

    Lastly, while it is your responsibility, no medical expert should expect you to finish both bags within 20 minutes in a shift. This is an absurdly high bar that can only be reached by a handful of our most seasoned chemists and while that should be celebrated, it should never be considered the norm. If you see medical staff enforce this standard, tell your CMO immediately, or raise it to CentComm.

    ​[italic]Oh, ‘ere we go.[/italic]

    ​[head=3][color=SkyBlue]3a. Checklist of concepts to know[/color][/head]

    As a CMO, your responsibilities lie in ensuring your medbay is well-prepared for a crisis and properly handling a crisis as it arises. You are there to care for your doctors and make sure their needs are met while also supporting staff outside of the department.

    You are also the main person to look to when it comes to medical knowledge. This doesn’t mean that you need to know the ins-and-outs of everything, but there is a list of concepts you should be aware of before picking up the cape:
          ​[bullet] Chem knowledge - Can reliably make the basic chemicals and advanced brutes
          ​[bullet] Cryopod knowledge - No need to know how to make one from scratch, but rather how to start and maintain one.
          ​[bullet] Life thresholds - At what number someone is alive, crit, or dead, and efficient ways to treat them (e.g. necrosol needed for full poisoning, defibrillators can inherently heal asphyxiation)
          ​[bullet] Handling unrevivable entities - Understands the concept and consequences of making an MMI, can reliably delegate to staff to gather materials and create Opporozidone.

    ​[head=3][color=SkyBlue]3b. Checklist of prepwork[/color][/head]

    As the boss, you also have a checklist of tasks that must be ticked as soon as possible, similar to the Chemist and basic medicine:

    ​[italic]      1. Collect plasma, welding fuel and a generator for the Chemist
          2. Collect basic tools
          3. Communicate with Cargo to purchase Medfab materials (glass, steel, plastic)
          4. Rip the clothes in the chemvend for cloth, which can be used for more gauze
          5. Organize topicals near the stasis beds
          6. Order a chemvend restock from Cargo
          7. Collect an N2 and O2 canister
             Optional: Request medibots and a microwave from science
             Optional: Request specific plants from Botany
    ​[/italic]
    On top of all of this, you are also the go-to teacher for interns. Check your manifest every shift for any and verify with them if they need any help. Remember that each person learns differently, while some work best with guidebooks you can find in the Library, others have a much less overwhelming time while being instructed in-person as the shift advances. Communicate what works best for them!

    Sounds like a lot, don’t it? Well, that’s the neat part about CMO. Unlike chemists, you don’t have to do all of this on your own.

    ​[head=2][color=DeepSkyBlue]Good vs. Bad CMO Practices[/color][/head]

    What’s your best weapon as a CMO? If you said your hypo, picture me slapping it out of your fuckin’ hand.

    ​[head=3][color=SkyBlue]a. It’s Delegation.[/color][/head]

    The best CMO’s know how to delegate the tasks among the team and make sure everyone is contributing one way or another. Send out doctors for one of your checklist tasks, delegate chores to doctors like the crew monitor, and handle communication with other departments. Prioritize tasks. What would be more important, make additional medical beds or prepare more topicals?

    A good CMO knows how to plan ahead, and has the foresight to see where something can go wrong, but they leave the treatment work for the doctors any time they can. A bad CMO utilizes their hypo to wordlessly heal every patient when there are multiple capable doctors.

    As a CMO it is also your responsibility to check on your staff. Ensure everyone is interacting well (enough) to work together.

    ​[head=3][color=SkyBlue]b. Your Second Best Weapons: The Door Remote and Flash[/color][/head]

    Take this from a sod that’s been in hot water for this. You are not sec. You ain’t responsible for handling criminals, you’re responsible for treating crew. With that in mind, in the case a threat to the crew has been injured and arrives at your bay, it is allowed to delay treatment before a security officer arrives, or apply inhibiting drugs like chloral hydrate or pax.

    The case someone gets up and proves to be a threat to the staff is where your best weapons that share a second spot come in. The door remote dictates the flow of a medbay, and makes large rushes flow much faster if emergency access is enabled. Likewise, you can lock down the medbay to ensure someone with ill intentions doesn’t run away until an officer arrives. Then? Pop the flash. Most ill-willed people don’t invest into flash protection, and it lets you steal whatever weapon they had in their hands at the time.

    What is absolutely forbidden is to injure a crew member on purpose, you or any doctor. Again, you ain’t sec and intentionally dealing harm to a crew is subject to space law, no matter if they’re a small time thief or someone that would be charged with capital punishment. Granted, self-defense is an exception. Do no harm but take no shit.

    You’re always a doctor, never an executioner
    The only thing you should care for, as a CMO, is to ensure the crew is healthy. As someone with command access, you have a direct line to contact both the HoS, as well as the Warden. Additionally, you also have the Brigmed with Medical comms access. For an efficient handoff of people that are supposed to serve a sentence, coordinate and communicate with those people as clear as possible.

    On the topic of “you are not sec”, know what ye also ain’t? An executioner! Under no circumstance can you choose for yourself to execute a crew member, no matter how much harm they have done. You can throw your hat in the ring, but that decision is ultimately left to the HoS and the Captain. The only case where your decision is final is if you are the only Command member standing, there is no security, but at that point you should be elevated to an interim captain rather than a CMO.

    ​[head=3][color=SkyBlue]c. Rules of Engagement Towards Patients[/color][/head]

    (As much as NT don’t want ye to believe,) you are a person! And a person’s gotta socialise, so socialise! Most of treatment is waiting for the medicine to kick in, so take the time to make some small talk. Ask them about the day, about how they got injured, or flirt with them like most of the department does with each other, all while you’re licking their wounds (dinnae take this as advice).

    As mentioned in the MD’s responsibilities, all doctors must respect the wishes of staff that are within reason. Patients can refuse any treatment, or a specific type, and disrespecting it will get you in hot water with the CMO and security. So don’t do that. Or do, I ain’t yer dad. But watch out!

    On that topic, as much as I’d like it to be, this ain’t a boxing ring. You see a patient not following protocol, wasting resources or just generally being a nuisance, save the punch as a last resort. Generally pointing at them or shouting their name is enough to get their attention. My best advice is simply following escalation protocol if you have a problem with someone, be it a patient or a colleague.

    Does that mean to never be violent and always be buddy buddy with each other? FUCK no, ae’d have gone mad by now! Be rough when you have to, but remember that we are all people here. Save a punch for when you really mean it.

    ​[head=3][color=SkyBlue]Closing Thoughts[/color][/head]

    ​[italic]Real cute if ye managed 'ta read this far.[/italic]

    A close friend, 'nother CMO, once told me something when referring to Medical.

    "We are the anchor."

    Yer the last line until someone's loved one is gone. It can be a lot on the mind. Make sure to out for each other. I'm not telling you you're a family or some corporate shite... but agony does find company.

    One star only makes a spectacle, many stars are what makes a sky.
