	##Knowledge Points
	As a Heretic, your eldritch knowledge is what sets you above the heathens.
	
	Collecting Knowledge Points is your main goal, as well as your ticket to greater power.
	
	Knowledge Points can be spent in the knowledge store to unlock new spells and rituals.

	You can gain knowledge points and become stronger through a few ways:
	- Reading tomes that spawn randomly around the station.
	- Sacrificing crew members your dark patrons hunger for.
	- Automatically getting one knowledge point every 20 minutes.
	

	## Heretical Research
	Once you have some knowledge points, it's time to research! Open up your knowledge store using the action button.
	
	Your first selection will commit you to a path that defines your initial abilities and Final Ascension.
	
	You can earn abilities from other paths to a limited degree, but only when you have researched sufficient knowledge from your main path.


	## Eldritch Tomes

	Tomes are the easy way to gain knowledge points. Whenever there are Heretics aboard Space Station 14, tomes will randomly spawn across the station.
	
	Each will provide a single knowledge point upon use. Be mindful in your search - drawing too much attention to yourself could mean the end of your studies.

	Each book can only be harvested once, so the more tomes you gain access to first, the less killing you have to do to reach ascension.
