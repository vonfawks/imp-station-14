  [color=red]Caution! This species has several SEVERELY limiting game mechanics and is only recommended for highly experienced players. Some jobs and tasks may be difficult or impossible to perform by yourself with only one hand.[/color]

  Allulalo are a reclusive species of sauropods native to the IMP-sector outer nebulae. They are rarely seen, preferring to conceal their cities deep inside asteroid fields and mask their movements with stealth fields or radio jammers. Investigations into whether they pose a security risk to nearby stations is ongoing, but outside of rare sightings among shuttle crews, their elusive nature has significantly stifled progress.

  Observation records confirm higher land-speeds than traditionally seen among humanoids, but the unusual, pentafurcated beak they use for manipulating in the place of traditional "hands" seems to [color=#ffa500]prevent them from wielding any large weaponry.[/color] Their height also makes them unable to interface with most NT standard devices, and they are frequently seen [color=#ffa500]standing on chairs and tables or using anti-gravity technology to reach the controls.[/color]

  # Biology

  Allulalo do not have any abnormalities in their resistance to damage, but are [color=#ffa500]25% more vulnerable to stuns, and their low body mass causes them to be thrown farther by impacts[/color].

  It is easy to underestimate Allulalo due to these drawbacks, but they have a major strength: [color=#1e90ff]They are incredibly mobile, and can easily outpace most humanoid species[/color].

  Allulalo are also in unique posession of a highly methylated bloodstream. Due to this, [color=#1e90ff]their blood naturally evaporates on its own[/color], as well as making them [color=#1e90ff]remarkably heavyweight drinkers[/color] for their body weight.

  In addition to their methylated blood, their beak saliva contains small amounts of the [color=#1e90ff]blood clotting agent and adreno-stimulant ethanotoxin[/color]. Allulalo have been recorded biting eachother in critical situations in order to clot wounds and boost adrenaline.

  # Physical Strength

  Allulalo have naturally lower body mass due to their small stature, and as such have difficulty dragging things larger than themselves.

  As a result of both this and their lack of multiple "hands", Allulalo are uniquely poised to benefit from science research such as [color=#1e90ff]HARMpacks[/color] and [color=#1e90ff]tether guns[/color], and their smaller size [color=#1e90ff]allows them to pilot VIMs[/color].
