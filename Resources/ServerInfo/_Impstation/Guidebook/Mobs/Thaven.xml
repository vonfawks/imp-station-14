  [color=#ffa500]Caution! This species has a severely limiting game mechanic and is not recommended for new players.[/color]
  [color=#ffa500]This mechanic makes it very difficult to form a consistent character or personality, as it can severely affect the way a Thaven speaks and interacts with others.[/color]

## Moods

  The Thaven have a unique brain structure, similar to a positronic brain, and thus have "Moods" which affect them similarly to a borg's Laws.

  [color=#ffa500]These Moods must be followed to the best of your ability![/color] [color=red]A Thaven's Moods as-written are non-diegetic gameplay features. They should be treated as things your character believes to be facts - and should not be referenced by name or wording.[/color] [color=#ffa500]A Mood being violated by yourself or others is uncomfortable or disquieting. The specifics of that are up to you, but if a Mood is violated, you must seek to correct the mistake immediately.[/color]

  [color=red]Following your moods affords you a limited license to do certain things which would otherwise be against the rules, if approached with proper escalation. If you have a question about this, don't hesitate to ask using the Ahelp feature (F1).[/color]

## Mood Swings
  Thaven brains are susceptible to fluctuations in electromagnetic fields. As a result, their ability to synchronize and regulate their Moods tends to degrade with extended exposure to the cosmic rays and ion storms that permeate NT stations. [color=#ffa500]It also renders them vulnerable to EM fields generated by the syndicate Cryptographic Sequencer, or EMAG,[/color] which can give them additional, often severely debilitating moods.

## Thaven Nerve Pinch
  Thaven hand-to-hand martial arts have a focus on inflicting non-permanent damage. As a result, [color=#ffa500]their unarmed attacks are slow, and deal no damage,[/color] but [color=#1e90ff]cause a fair amount of stun buildup.[/color]

## Physiology
  Thaven biochemistry is flexible, allowing them to derive energy from a wide variety of different gases. As such, [color=#1e90ff]Thaven are immune to asphyxiation,[/color] so long as there is something to breathe. [color=#ffa500]They can still be poisoned by toxic gases.[/color]

  Due to their relatively fragile bone structure and unique nervous system, they take [color=#ffa500]10% more damage from blunt, slash, pierce, and genetic, and 20% more damage from radiation,[/color] but their unique ancestry allows them to take [color=#1e90ff]10% less damage from heat, cold, and poison.[/color]

  Constant exposure to ion storms is deterimental to the long-term health of spacefaring Thaven. [color=#ffa500]They have slightly shorter lifespans than most other NT-employed species.[/color]

 ## Thaven Naming Conventions

  Thaven typically name themselves after a single virtue they hold dear. Sometimes these names can be long and unwieldy.
