  The following is a basic primer on what to expect and how to participate in roleplay on Impstation. This is for everyone, but also provides a quickstart intro for those who may be new to roleplay (or just new to Impstation's server culture).

  While the examples provided here aren't strict rules so much as they are guidelines, everything here is also implicitly covered by server rules. Use this guide to manage your expectations for roleplay in tandem with the [textlink="server rules" link="DefaultRuleset"].

  This guide is divided into three sections:

  [textlink="Engagement with Other Players" link="RPGuidePlayers"]
  - Covers roleplay consent, character relationships, character backstory, and "yes and / no but".

  [textlink="Engagement with The Game" link="RPGuideGame"]
  - Covers the differences between MRP (medium roleplay) versus LRP (low roleplay) and HRP (high roleplay).

  [textlink="Managing Your Out Of Character Emotions" link="RPGuideEmotions"]
  - Discusses the separation between in-character and out-of-character (IC and OOC) experiences, and examples of how to approach aspects of the game that incur OOC frustration.
