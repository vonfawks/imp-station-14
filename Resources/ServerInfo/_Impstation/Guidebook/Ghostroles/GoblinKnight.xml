## Rules
Sir Gollylad is a [color=yellow]Familiar[/color], a goblin knight who serves a chivalric order. Dressed in the garb of a hero of the goblin people, Gollylad is called upon to protect important nobles from the wild dangers of deep space.

Given that the knight has a unique ability to [color=cyan]pry open powered doors[/color] with her bare hands, his service can be quite the thing to receive. Unfortunately, the poor soul forgot exactly [italic]who[/italic] he was called upon to protect, so she has to [color=#1e90ff]choose someone at random.[/color]

As with all other Familiars, Gollylad does the bidding of its master, regardless of what that may be. This naturally means that if their master is an antagonist, they can be asked to do antagonistic things. Gollylad is a knight of honor, however, and [color=red]cannot choose to do antagonistic things of her own free will.[/color]
