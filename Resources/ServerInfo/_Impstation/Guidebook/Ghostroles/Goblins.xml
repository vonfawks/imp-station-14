Goblins are a strange race of humanoid beings. They are small, fragile, and adapted to environments that other humanoid species tend to find unsanitary. Resultantly, they take [color=#1e90ff]25% less damage from Poison, and 10% less damage from Caustic sources[/color] but [color=#ffa500]20% more damage from Blunt, Piercing, and Slashing sources.[/color]

Due to their small stature, [color=#1e90ff]they can easily be picked up and moved by larger humanoid species.[/color]

## Culture

Goblin culture is an enigma to NT researchers. They speak a unique pidgin form of Galactic Common, and yet the Research Division has yet to discover whether or not they have a home planet, let alone a system of governance. All NT encounters with Goblins have been in the form of stowaways aboard vessels and stations, with no clear point of origin. 

If you have any leads, please feel free to reach out to Central Command's Director of Research.

## Encounters
Goblins have been encountered by NT vessels occasionally throughout the years. The following are links to two accounts of such incidents:
