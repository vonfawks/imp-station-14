  [color=#ffa500]Caution! This species has a severely limiting game mechanic and is not recommended for new players. [/color]
  
  ## Special Accomodations
  
  Vox lungs function very differently from most other species. [color=#ffa500]They are only capable of processing nitrogen,[/color] which is converted to ammonia and exhaled. 
  
  Additionally, due to an unusual set of biological circumstances, [color=red][bold]oxygen is highly toxic to them.[/color][/bold] If exposed to oxygen, it will quickly build up in their blood, causing rapid onset organ failure and eventually death.
  
  Resultantly, [color=red][bold]Vox must be on internals at all times while aboard NT stations.[/color][/bold] [color=#ffa500]This may make it difficult for Vox to eat or drink normally,[/color] although direct injection of liquid food is possible.
  
  NT has made special accomodations for this species, [color=#1e90ff]including readily accessible nitrogen tanks in dispensers and lockers throughout most stations.[/color] Some stations may even have a "Vox Box," an enclosed nitrogen-rich environment devoid of oxygen.
  
  ## Damage
  
  Vox blood is anaerobic, [color=#1e90ff]but is iron-based, allowing it to be metabolized from iron supplements.[/color]
  
  As they possess talons, their unarmed attacks deal Slash damage instead of Blunt.

 ## Vox Naming Conventions

  Vox typically use a single name made of random syllables, often with repeating patterns.
  Names should not be excessively long or be so repetitive/convoluted as to be unreadable.
