  [color=#ffa500]Warning! This species is not recommended for new players due to their fatal allergy to oxygen![/color]

  Vox breathe nitrogen, and [color=#ffa500] oxygen is toxic to them.[/color]
  Unfortunately, space stations tend to be full of oxygen,
  so Vox must use an internal nitrogen supply at almost all times to avoid fatal exposure.

  Vox always spawn wearing working nitrogen internals equipment.
  A spare breathing mask and an emergency nitrogen canister is provided in their survival box.

  In addition to regular foods, Vox can also eat various snack packaging, banana peels, eggshells, and raw meat without any ill effects. They also like to drink welding fuel.

  Vox [color=#1e90ff]slowly recover from low levels of poison damage[/color] on their own, so long as they are careful not to exceed 20 poison damage.

  This allows them to endure breathing station air for up to thirty seconds at a time without lasting damage, letting them quickly eat, drink, take oral medication, and so on.

  A thirty second oxygen exposure takes them two minutes to recover from.

  If their health does not seem to improve within a minute of oxygen exposure, they should seek medical attention.

  NT has made special accomodations for this species, [color=#1e90ff]including readily accessible nitrogen tanks in dispensers and lockers throughout most stations.[/color] Some stations may even have a "Vox Box," an enclosed nitrogen-rich environment devoid of oxygen.

  ## Damage

  Vox blood is anaerobic, [color=#1e90ff]but is iron-based, allowing it to be metabolized from iron supplements.[/color]

  As they possess talons, their unarmed attacks deal Slash damage instead of Blunt.

 ## Vox Naming Conventions

  Vox typically use a single name made of random syllables, often with repeating patterns.
  Names should not be excessively long or be so repetitive/convoluted as to be unreadable.
