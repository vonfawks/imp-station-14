  Moths are somewhat unique among NT-accepted species, in that they have no commonly-accepted species name. Due to the lack of Earth moths aboard NT vessels and stations, most people are content with referring to them simply as Moths.
  
  Their wings don't allow them to fly under Earthlike gravity (as is generated by NT's proprietary Gravity Generators,) but [color=#1e90ff]under low gravity, they are capable of greater acceleration.[/color] Of course, this does not make them capable of unassisted space flight - but [color=#1e90ff]their skill and experience may make them more efficient fliers while using jetpacks.[/color]
  
  ## Dietary Restrictions
  Their unique mouthparts and dietary needs render them [color=#ffa500]incapable of consuming the same foods as other humanoids.[/color] Instead, [color=#1e90ff]Moths must eat textiles - cotton, fabric, or clothing.[/color] Some NT Chefs have developed specialty recipies to cater to their needs.

  ## Damage 
  Unlike most invertebrates, Moths have a circulatory system more similar to that of Humans. Their blood, while superficially similar to the haemolymph used by Earth insects, [color=#ffa500]cannot be metabolized from iron or copper.[/color]

  Due to their fluffy carapace, they are insulated from the cold, and take [color=#1e90ff]30% less Cold damage[/color] but [color=#ffa500]30% more Heat damage, and catch on fire more easily[/color].

  # Moth Naming Conventions

  Moths typically use Human-adjacent first names and light or nature themed last names.
