  Diona are a remarkable species, one of only a handful of sentient creatures known to have evolved from plants. Their woody roots allow them to [color=#1e90ff]ignore difficult terrain such as Kudzu,[/color] but [color=#ffa500]cannot fit into shoes made for other humanoids.[/color]
  
  ## Damage
  Rather than having a normal humanoid circulatory system, Diona use capillary action to pump nutrient-carrying sap throughout their bodies, [color=#ffa500]which cannot be metabolized from iron.[/color]
  As their metabolism is very similar to that of Earth plants, chemicals designed to affect the growth and function of other plants have similar effects on Diona. For example, [color=#ffa500]Weed Killer is poisonous to them,[/color] but [color=#1e90ff]Robust Harvest can be used to accelerate their healing [color=#ffa500](At risk of overdose, as explained in the section below.)[/color]

  Due to their stiff, woody exterior, they take [color=#1e90ff]30% less Blunt damage and 20% less Slash damage[/color] but [color=#ffa500]50% more Heat damage, 20% more Shock damage, and they can easily catch on fire when receiving enough Heat damage from *any* source.[/color]

  ## Overdose

  Being exposed to large quantities of Robust Harvest may [color=#ffa500]cause a Diona to grow out of control,[/color] rooting them in place in a sessile, tree-like form. [color=#1e90ff]This change can be reversed by severing the trunk from its root system.[/color]

  ## Diona Nymphs

  A Diona's internal organs are sometimes capable of independence after the death of the main body. [color=#1e90ff]These organs, if voluntarily expelled, will metamorphose into Nymphs, or larval Diona.[/color] Nymphs are capable of speech, but not much else. 
  
  After around ten minutes, a Nymph may undergo a second metamorphosis, [color=#1e90ff]reforming into an adult Diona.[/color] This new Diona will be [color=#ffa500]a new individual, with their own appearance, name, and personality,[/color] but may [color=#1e90ff]retain memories of who they were previously.[/color]
  
  ## Diona Naming Conventions
